<h1 style="color:blue;">Asurtur blood</h1>

<p style="color:red;">Have you at anytime witnessed a relative of yours or a close friend searching frantically for a blood donor, when blood banks say out of stock, the donors in mind are out of reach and the time keeps ticking? Have you witnessed loss of life for the only reason that a donor was not available at the most needed hour? Is it something that we as a society can do nothing to prevent? This thought laid our foundation.

"asurtur blood" is an organization that brings voluntary blood donors and those in need of blood on to a common platform.  Through this website, we seek donors who are willing to donate blood, as well as provide the timeliest support to those in frantic need of it.</p>

<p style="color:green;">Our vision is to be “The hope of every Indian in search of a voluntary blood donor”

Our motto - “Donate blood to save the most precious human life”
